## Rules
There are 13 rounds in a game of Yahtzee. In each turn, a player can roll his/her dice up to 3 times
in order to get the desired combination. On the first roll, the player rolls all five of the dice at
once. On the second and third rolls, the player can roll any number of dice he/she wants to,
including none or all of them, trying to get a good combination. The player can choose whether
he/she wants to roll once, twice or three times in each turn. After the three rolls in a turn, the
player must put his/her score down on the scorecard, under any one of the thirteen categories. The
score that the player finally gets for that turn depends on the category/box that he/she chooses and
the combination that he/she got by rolling the dice. But once a box is chosen on the score card, it
can't be chosen again.
