# The Door Game

The rules to this game are simple. You are given 3 doors to choose form, behind one of the doors is the 'Prize'. If you
choose the correct door on the first attempt you win, if not you will be given an opportunity to change your door. If
you choose incorrectly the second time, you lose the game. Good Luck!
