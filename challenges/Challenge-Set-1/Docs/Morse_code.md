# Morse code
Morse code was originally invented to send a signal over a wire to transmit a message. The length and sequence of the tones corresponded to various letters in the English language. Morse code is not used much in its original capacity anymore, but does provide for a naturally occuring cipher where each letter of the english language is represented by a series of characters that corresponds to the length of the tone one would hear when operating a morse line.

Morse lines are a thing of the past, but the textual representation of morse characters is still used for many things. Below is a table representing the conversion from english to morse code.
