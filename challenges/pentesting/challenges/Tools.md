**Web:**

- DIRB
  DIRB is a web content scanner , intended to assist in mapping out directories of  websites. It accepts an address as input and then, using preconfigured wordlists, attempts to discover hidden pages. DIRB essentially conducts a dictionary attack on web structures by guessing commonly used page names.

**Scanning:**

- Nmap
  Network Mapper, more commonly known as Nmap, is used to for vulnerability scanning and network discovery. It can be used to observe devices connected to a network, while also probing for running services or open ports. Nmap can monitor single hosts or explore large networks and gather information on hundreds of thousands of devices. Nmap’s ability to interact with entire networks while acquiring information on individual hosts make it an effective tool to map networks and build device profiles.
  - How To Install: *sudo apt install ncat*
  - More Information: https://nmap.org/
- Metasploit Framework
  The Metasploit Framework is used to probe systems for known vulnerabilities with prebuilt tools. Metasploit provides an ever-expanding library of known security weaknesses each accompanied by prebuilt payloads to exploit it. By supplying its users with these tools, it allows for quicker penetration testing without any need to develop payloads. 
  - How To Install: Can be downloaded from Rapid7 : https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Nightly-Installers
  - More Information: <https://www.metasploit.com/> 
- Recon-ng
  Recon-ng is framework equipped with tools to assist its users in completing quick and effective web reconnaissance. Its modules allow its users to conduct tests for misconfigured SQL queries, conduct port scans, perform DNS lookups and so much more.
  - How To Install: *sudo apt install recon-ng*
  - More Information: https://www.kali.org/tools/recon-ng/

**Network Traffic Analysis:**

- Wireshark
  Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer and is extremely useful when diagnosing or observing network traffic. It is most commonly used to capture network packets which it displays at a granular level. Wireshark allows Network Administrators to break down network activity by protocol and more closely examine network traffic.
  - How To Install: Can downloaded from Wireshark https://www.wireshark.org/#download
  - More Information: https://www.wireshark.org/
- tcpdump
  Tcpdump is a network capture and protocol analysis tool. It can be used to capture TCP,UDP and ICMP traffic, for offline analysis. Tcpdump is commonly used to diagnosis network problems because it allows it allows it’s users to examine packet contents as they traverse the network.  
  - How To Install: *sudo apt install tcpdump*
  - More Information: https://www.tcpdump.org/
- ngrep
  Much the same as Linux’s ‘grep’, ngrep allows network packets to be searched by regular or hexadecimal expressions to help filter out network traffic and allow for quicker network packet analysis. 
  - How To Install: sudo apt install ngrep
  - More Information: https://www.kali.org/tools/ngrep/

**Enumeration and Exploitation:**

- ‘File’ Command
  The file command accepts a file as input and then determines the file type. This especially useful when dealing with files without extension.
