## -Strings

The command _strings_ is a built in command for the majority of Linux Distributions. The Strings command is useful for investigating binary files. Binary files, while possible to examine with other Linux commands, are composed of a sequence of bytes. This information is valuable to a processor but are not easily examined by humans.

In order to better examine the contents of a binary file, you can run _strings_, which extracts any readable text from the file and displays it. For example, lets assume we have a binary of a Hello World C file. The C code shown below.

```c

#include <stdio.h>

int main()

{
    char* name = "Hello World";

    for (int counter = 0; counter < 3; counter++)
    {
        printf("%c", name);
    }

}

```

We can run strings against the binary by typing strings followed by the file name.

```Bash

root: $ strings hello

```

Below if a portion of the output generated by the binary Hello World

```Bash

_/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2_

_printf_

_\_\_cxa\_finalize_

_\_\_libc\_start\_main_

_libc.so.6_

_GLIBC\_2.2.5_

_\_ITM\_deregisterTMCloneTable_

_\_\_gmon\_start\_\__

_\_ITM\_registerTMCloneTable_

_u/UH_

_[]A\A]A^A\__

_Hello World_

_;\*3$&quot;_

_GCC: (Debian 10.2.1-6) 10.2.1 20210110_

```

Notice it provides file properties but also any text in the file. In our example, you&#39;ll notice the string Hello World, which was a string specified in the original C file.

**To Do:** Use strings to unlock the lock binary and acquire the flag.
