# CTF
Capture the Flag is usually a competition between highly skilled individuals to
see who can breach a computer system first. With our CTF platform, we want to
make it easy for beginners (ideally high school or early college) to get started
learning in the computer security field.

## Documentation
Our documentation is currently under construction as of writing, but you can
check in on our progress by visiting https://acasi-ctf.github.io/docs/.
