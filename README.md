# CTF Project Prototype
This project contains (or will contain) a number of libraries and applications that are sort of a
"sandbox" to prove certain concepts during our planning stage.

## What's being used here?
In terms of code, everything here is implemented in Go as of writing this. Various libraries are
depended upon, Protobuf and gRPC being big ones.

## How do I get started?
TODO
