# Sprint 2 Retrospective Summary
[Recording]()

## What went well
* Demo
* UI
  * Routing implemented in UI.
  * Auth0 implemented for creating user accounts.
* Team split up
  * Colby - Team Management / Issue Tracking
  * Richard + Colby - User Interface
  * Ethan - WebDev challenge and getting DVWA setup on docker
  * Zhaohu - Cipher challenge
  * Logan - Bootstrapping backend with Kubernetes

## What didn't go so well
* Over Ambitious
  * Did not accomplish as much as intended. Goals were ambitious, but most of us had little to no
    experience in the specific area we are working in. With the exception of Logan,
      everyone on the team is learning a new skillset to accomplish this project. Spent more time learning than coding.
* Communicating progress
  * Getting people to provide status updates through the GitHub issues was like pulling teeth for some. I found myself constantly
    looking for resources that were probably available, but we couldn't find them because team members never provided
      any status updates to notify anyone of completion.

## How can we change our process?

* Issue Tracking
  * Recommended that everyone start tracking and creating their own GitHub issues. This will allow
    the whole group to better keep track of everyone's progress and to know when someone else is waiting
    on them for a component to continue development.
  * Recommended that users create issues for other users when they are waiting on a component that is being created by
    someone else.
* Cloud Services
  * We need to get as much of this project onto a cloud service as soon as possible so that we can start testing rest
    APIs.
  * We have petitioned F5 to create an account for us on Digital Ocean to migrate everything to. We are just
    waiting on feedback.
