[Recording](https://emailwsu.sharepoint.com/teams/2021.PULLM.CptS.421.423-F5CTF/Shared%20Documents/F5%20CTF/Retrospective/Retrospective%20Meeting%203.mp4)

## What went well
* Communication is improving
  * Communication in general has been a big improvement over the first two
    sprints, but still needs work, as detailed below.
* Productive sprint
  * All had been working on separate components up until now, but finally
    integrated all of our pieces together.

## What didn't go so well
* Trying to create content for our target audience
  * Ethan mentioned it was difficult for him to come up with ideas or content
    for challenges, as he may have been assuming that our target audience was
    more knowledgeable than they actually are. Zhaohu also had this problem
    while creating his challenges.
* Lack of required knowledge
  * Ethan mentions that he had been struggling with figuring out Docker. Logan
    mentions later that he can help with that.
  * Richard didn't have enough time or knowledge to figure out how to utilize
    the REST API for loading challenge sets, challenges, and the respective
    documentation for each. For now, he hard coded it, but later on, we will be
    fixing that.
* Communication still has problems.
  * Colby mentions how he, as the project lead, has issues keeping track of
    team member's progress. People don't tend to commit or update issues as
    often as they should, so it hampers his ability to manage the team
    effectively.

## How can we change our process?
* Push code frequently
  * Allows Colby to manage the team more effectively and also generally gives
    other team members an understanding, if need be, of other's progress without
    talking to Colby or said team member.
* Utilize GitHub more
  * Ethan mentioned how he hasn't used GitHub with a larger group, so he needs
    to learn a bit more about the process. Richard also has these same issues.
* Start using CI/CD more
  * Logan set up code coverage as of the last week of sprint 3, which only
    reports for a small portion of our codebase, but as time goes on, we will be
    adding more reporting and writing more tests to improve code coverage across
    the board.
